# mspbot

mspbot is a Discord bot for MovieStarPlanet that interacts with the game to get information about players.  

I apologize for the poor quality of the code, it has not been rewritten since 2021.  
This project has not been updated for a while and is no longer working. I wouldn't update it because the MovieStarPlanet bot I owned no longer exists.  

If you want to complete this project, feel free to fork this project and then propose me your modifications, I will add them.  
To make it work, you may need to look into how to generate a histogram so you can send requests to MSP afterwards.

## Requirements

You must have [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) from version 14.  
You must have a [MongoDB Server](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).  
You must have an MSP account on each server with the same username and password.  
You need a brain to rewrite the MSP TjData to histogram builder.  
You must complete the configuration file `config.json`.

## Usage

Download the dependencies with `npm install` then start the bot with `node msp.js`.
